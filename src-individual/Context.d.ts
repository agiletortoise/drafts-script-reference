/**
 * A single global "context" object is available to scripts to control flow of the currently running action.
 *
 * It is important to understand that `cancel()` and `fail()` will not immediately stop script, just stop any further action steps from being performed.
 *
 * @example
 * 
 * **Control Flow**
 * 
 * ```javascript
 * // test for logical condition before continuing
 * if (!validationCondition) {
 *   context.fail();
 * }
 * // code below will still run.
 * ```
 * 
 * **Retreive values**
 * 
 * ```javascript
 * // if a "Run Workflow" step preceded this script, lets look for a result
 * let response = context.callbackResponses[0];
 * if (response) {
 *   // Workflow returns one "result" parameter, other apps may use other values.
 *   var result = response["result"];
 *   if (result) {
 *     // so something with the result
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
